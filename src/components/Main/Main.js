              Hi, my name is Josue Flores and I'm a full stack developer. Some
              of the technologies I'm familiar with, and have implemented into
              this Web App, include HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I built
              the frontend with adaptive web design in mind as well as building
              reusable components and writing scalable code. I'm currently
              working on the backend using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. I have
              experience using GitHub and Git version control system. I have
              taken courses through TripleTen Coding Bootcamp. I've learned so
              much thorughout the course, I'm sure I've missed adding some of
              those things here. This was built from the ground up, by me, to
              showcase some of the skills I've learned at TripleTen.
